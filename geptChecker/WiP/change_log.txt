# HOW TO WORK WITH THIS APP
corrections should be made to individual files. Final file should be assembled using `toggleWordlistHTML.py`.
The name of the stand alone file should then be changed to `wordlistTool.htm`.

## Logic:
open geptchecker
read through each line
ignore anything commented out (in html / css / javascript) EXCEPT:

### create files (i.e. "split mode") if encounter `data-title`:
<script data-title="blah.js"></script>
—> <script src="blah.js"></script>

<style data-title="blah.css"></style>
—> <link href="blah.css" rel="stylesheet" />

OR
### combine files if finds above links to external files,
("combine-into-single-file mode")
open filename & replace link with contents into tags

# ISSUES TO RESOLVE
*in-place editing still glitchy (especially adding text at end.) NB: this seems to be caused by 'refresh' button showing, but mode being set to 'autorefresh'!!
refresh mode not always saved? problem with 'reset'?
hidden characters (e.g. @EOL@ displayed in backup) in in-place editing.

ALTERNATIVE:
change 'in-place' to show multiple senses ONLY as red squiggly underline; resolved in info box

# LIST OF CORRECTIONS:
4-11-2023 correct vocab mistake: (gept.js / .json) 'benefit' changed from 'nj' to 'nv' so that 'benefited' is correctly recognized
14-11-2023 vocab mistake: (global.js) 'misunderstood' added as irregular past of 'misunderstand'
03-01-2024 fixed cursor handling for in-place editing mode (but other fixes needed to make this mode work)
07-01-2024 fixed switching between editing & refresh modes; cleaned up code; added more acceptable patterns for digits
08-01-2024 fixed missing newlines when switching from in-place to 2-col
... grey out 'auto refresh' option when in in-place mode


20-03-2024 added corrections to wordlist creation: streamlined process a little & Americanized/corrected AWL source file .tsv's

TODO:

wordlistTool: implement a check for British spellings in input & flag as "change to preferred US spelling/term + correct term". This is because the GEPT wordlist now (still slightly unreliably) records UK spelling variants.
Use a dynamic system rather than hardwired list (as there are inconsistencies in the GEPT list):
Implement these checks:

ae > e
-ll > l
-ence > ense
-e > nowt
-our > or
-re > er
-ize > ise
-yze > yse

need to add in contraction / digit / symbol / unknown etc.
need to work out a new way of identifying variants (from id lookup  OR rewrite type tag to 'v'
create a new 'central switching room' based on entry.type in buildMarkupAsHTML()

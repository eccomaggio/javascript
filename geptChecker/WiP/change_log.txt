# HOW TO WORK WITH THIS APP
corrections should be made to individual files. Final file should be assembled using `toggleWordlistHTML.py`.
The name of the stand alone file should then be changed to `wordlistTool.htm`.

## Logic:
open geptchecker
read through each line
ignore anything commented out (in html / css / javascript) EXCEPT:

### create files (i.e. "split mode") if encounter `data-title`:
<script data-title="blah.js"></script>
—> <script src="blah.js"></script>

<style data-title="blah.css"></style>
—> <link href="blah.css" rel="stylesheet" />

OR
### combine files if finds above links to external files,
("combine-into-single-file mode")
open filename & replace link with contents into tags

# ISSUES TO RESOLVE
*in-place editing still glitchy (especially adding text at end.) NB: this seems to be caused by 'refresh' button showing, but mode being set to 'autorefresh'!!
refresh mode not always saved? problem with 'reset'?
hidden characters (e.g. @EOL@ displayed in backup) in in-place editing.

ALTERNATIVE:
change 'in-place' to show multiple senses ONLY as red squiggly underline; resolved in info box
